            A stay at the Native Place guesthouse gives you the essence of village life without, however, the accompanied hardships. Here you can indulge in nature’s delights, while children can learn about sustainable ecological Indian village life that is fast disappearing.<br>
            Native Place is a great weekend destination, but it is not just a one-night destination. Although we would be perfectly happy for you if you choose to lounge around and simply ‘do nothing’, which we believe is an art in itself; we have laid out some options of what you could do here over a few days.<br>
