            Come experience outdoor living without the accompanied hardships. We offer you tents on a twin and triple sharing basis in the lovely Native Place garden. Wake up to the sound of chirping birds, fall asleep lulled by the buzzing sounds of crickets and cicadas or keep the flap up and stare up at the stars. <br>
             The tents are set up with mattresses, sheets and pillows and also have a protective insect meshing so you can enjoy a peaceful nomadic stay.
